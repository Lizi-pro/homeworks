             for the Internet  
            <i>(World Wide Web)</i> or an intranet (a private network).<sup>[1]</sup> Web development can range from developing a simple single 
            static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network 
            services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include 
            Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side 
            scripting, <ins>Web server and network security configuration</ins>, and <del>e-commerce development</del>.

                Among Web professionals, <em>"Web development"</em> usually refers to the main non-design 
                aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.<sup>[2]</sup> Web development may use

                <sub>(CMS)</sub> to make content changes easier and available with basic 
                technical skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                For larger organizations and businesses, <b>Web development</b> teams can consist of hundreds 
                of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like

                while developing Web sites.<sup>[1]</sup> Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or 
                contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic 
                designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort 
                between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds 
                of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack 
                developer.<sup>[3]</sup> Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in 
                the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.<sup>[4]</sup> Since the 
                commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most 
                used technologies ever.

            <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> created <b>the World Wide Web</b> 
                in 1989 at CERN.<sup>[5]</sup></p>
            <p>
                The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated 
                information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with institutions and various 
                global organizations. Consequently, HTML was developed in 1993.<sup>[6]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                <mark>Web 1.0</mark> is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material 
                and provide a small amount of information.<sup>[7]</sup> Core protocols of web 1.0 were HTTP, 
                HTML and URI.<sup>[8]</sup>
            </p>
            <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Web 2.0</mark>, a term popularised by Dale Dougherty, then vice president of O'Reilly, 
                during a <i>2004</i> conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, 
                emphasizing interactivity.<sup>[9][10]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. 
                It evolved from the static, read-only nature of Web 1.0 and became 
                an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often 
                referred to as a <em>user-focused</em>, read-write online network.<sup>[7]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform 
                that encourages sharing activities such as creating <del>music, files, images, 
                and movies.</del><sup>[11]</sup> The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the "backbone 
                of the internet," using standardized XML <sub>(Extensible Markup Language)</sub> tags to 
                authorize information flow from independent platforms and online databases.<sup>[7]</sup>
            </p>
            <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
            <p>
                <mark>Web 3.0</mark>, considered the third and current version of the web, 
                was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign 
                of the web. Key features include the integration of metadata, precise 
                information delivery, and improved user experiences based on preferences, 
                history, and interests.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                <mark>Web 3.0</mark> aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing 
                more functionality than traditional search engines. Users can customize 
                navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve identifying 
                data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

               HTML

                 pages in the early days of the internet. Over time, 
                advancements led to the incorporation of CSS for styling 
                and JavaScript for interactivity. This evolution transformed 
                static websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting 
                the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.
